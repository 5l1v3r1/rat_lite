<h3>Remote Access Library</h3>
<p>To build this library, you need to download two additional repos that I am maintaining:<br/>
https://github.com/smasherprog/Mouse_Capture<br/> and <br/>https://github.com/smasherprog/Screen_Capture</p>
<p>Place these libraries in the same folder as this library, for example this is what it should look like:<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smasherprog/Remote_Access_Library/master/layout.PNG"/></p>
<p>Once you have the repos, you can start building. I have a .sln file for windows platform in the Remote_Access_Library for building on windows.</p>
<h4>Note for Contributors:</h4>
<p>Please search for cross-platform solutions to problems. If there are none, please try to seperate the platform specific code into their own .cpp files and #ifdef the code.</p>
